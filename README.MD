## Testing

I started the testing using for LightHouse from Google. I learn  that even from an expert like google you can't expect exact results every time. So i am going to show you here the best result. Even some time performance is droping to 80 because they can't acces bootstrap css ?!?

## Fixes after testing with lighthouse

- I learn in the hard way that converting a JPG to WEBP is not always usefull, the image can be even heavier after conversion in some cases. For this reason i had to change hero image because whas a bit more that 2mb. Now i have a 187 KB image that boosted the performance.

- Thanks to lighthouse i learn to add rel="noopener" to any target="_blank" for security. So thanks.

- was no so much to fix here only that rel="noopener" in all links.
- can be done to reduce images sizes, but 10 is for teachers.
